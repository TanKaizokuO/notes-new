# Special Applications — Face Recognition & Neural Style Transfer


This week focuses on two major CNN applications:
* [[Face Recognition]]
* [[Neural Style Transfer]]

**Key Theme**: Instead of only performing classification (softmax), these applications often require:
* Learning embeddings and similarity metrics.
* Extracting content/style features from intermediate CNN layers.

**Also Included**:
* [[1D and 3D Generalizations of CNNs]]
