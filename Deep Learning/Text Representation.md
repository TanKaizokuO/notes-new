# Text Representation

Text representation is the process of converting **raw text into numerical features** so that ML algorithms can process it.

$$\text{Text} \to \text{Numeric Vector}$$

## NLP Feature Engineering Pipeline
1.  **Raw text**
2.  **Cleaning + Preprocessing**
3.  **Tokenization** (words, subwords)
4.  **Mathematical representation** (vectors)
5.  **Modeling** & **Evaluation**

---

## Approaches
1.  [[Basic Vectorization Approaches]] (Sparse)
2.  [[Distributed Representation (Embeddings)]] (Dense)

---

## Vector Space Model (VSM)
Text units (words, sentences, documents) are represented as vectors of numbers. This algebraic model is called a **Vector Space Model**.
